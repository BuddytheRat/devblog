Well, I did say basic theme, and it is very, very basic. I've also set everything up where can do a Git push directly to the live server, which is extremely cool. So, once this post is written and hosted on the server, we're almost done with our list!

I think I am on to something with this blog + todo list format.
I like the blog because, even if nobody is reading, it's a form of reflection that is healthy and useful, and lists are a way of setting achievable goals for the immediate future. It's one look back, one look forward. The combination of retrograde and forward thinking creates a balance which fully grounds you in the present.

Here's our list so far:

- ~~Finish my first post.~~
- ~~Build a basic blog theme in Hexo.~~
- ~~Host the blog online.~~
- ~~Make another post, to let my fans know I made it this far.~~
- Make another list, to let my fans know I plan to go farther.

Next post will be a new list and new set of goals as I continue to develop. Thank you for reading!
