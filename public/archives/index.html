		<p>Learning Hexo today (a static site generator), and creating a new blog. It occured to me that most of this development stuff consists of simple, basic building blocks, of which I have a very good understanding. The real challenge, and in my experience, the quickest and surest dead end to all my past endeavors, then, is <em>creation</em>. Itâ€™s scary to be up against a void, with all the uncertainty of the future bearing down on you. The unending thoughts that I am not good enough, or that the world is too fast for me to keep up. Computers are designing games these days, so what use is this ancient human brain of mine? What good could all of these ideas swimming in my head possibly be to anyone?</p>
<p>Yet, here I am.</p>
