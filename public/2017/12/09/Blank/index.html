	<p>Learning Hexo today (a static site generator), and creating a new blog. It occured to me that most of this development stuff consists of simple, basic building blocks, of which I have a very good understanding. The real challenge, and in my experience, the quickest and surest dead end to all my past endeavors, then, is <em>creation</em>. It’s scary to be up against a void, with all the uncertainty of the future bearing down on you. The unending thoughts that I am not good enough, or that the world is too fast for me to keep up. Computers are designing games these days, so what use is this ancient human brain of mine? What good could all of these ideas swimming in my head possibly be to anyone?</p>
<p>Yet, here I am.</p>

<p>Creativity isn’t a mysterious secret sauce or a magic word or a gift from god. I know that discipline is the root of the problem. I know that action preceeds motivation. I know that at the end of the day, when I have time to myself, I need to just sit the fuck down and <em>do the thing</em>, everytime, without stopping. It’s so completely obvious, so easy to understand. </p>
<p>.. and then the moment fades, and I move on, feeling worse each time. I need to tattoo that shit onto myself so I can’t forget again. I’ve forgotten and rememebered so many times I’ve lost track. It can’t continue like this. Can’t keep forgetting. Can’t delay any longer. </p>
<p>My future depends on it.</p>
<p>I’ve learned to appreciate the power of lists, so here’s a list of tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><del>Finish this post.</del></li>
<li>Build a basic blog theme in Hexo.</li>
<li>Host the blog online.</li>
<li>Make another post, to let my fans know I made it this far.</li>
<li>Make another list, to let my fans know I plan to go farther.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s one thing crossed off the list. Goodnight.</p>
