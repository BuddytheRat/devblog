	<p>Well, I did say basic theme, and it is very, very basic.</p>
<p>I’ve set everything up where can do a Git push directly to the live server, which is extremely cool.</p>
<p>Once this post is written and hosted on the server, we’re almost done with our list!</p>
<p>I think I am on to something with this blog + todo list format.<br>I like the blog because, even if nobody is reading, it’s a form of reflection that is healthy and useful, and lists are a way of setting achievable goals for the immediate future. It’s one look back, one look forward. The combination of retrograde and forward thinking creates a balance which fully grounds you in the present.</p>
<p>Here’s our list so far:</p>
<ul>
<li><del>Finish my first post.</del></li>
<li><del>Build a basic blog theme in Hexo.</del></li>
<li><del>Host the blog online.</del></li>
<li><del>Make another post, to let my fans know I made it this far.</del></li>
<li>Make another list, to let my fans know I plan to go farther.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next post will be a new list and new set of goals as I continue to develop. Thank you for reading!</p>
